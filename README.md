# sninja

`sninja` is a CLI tool written in Go for managing common operations on the Street Ninja production server.

It's designed to centralize shell commands and streamline tasks like viewing logs, running Django management commands, and deploying updates â€” all from a single, easy-to-use interface.

This project is still in the early stages and will expand as needed.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker installed (for container-based operations)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/sninja.git
cd sninja
go build -o sninja
./sninja
